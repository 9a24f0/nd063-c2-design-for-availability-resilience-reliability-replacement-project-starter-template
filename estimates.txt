In case of single AZ outage, we fully rely on AWS resiliency. According to AWS
Documentation of Amazon RDS for MySQL, single AZ outage should be quote on quote
"minutes". As of experimenting, we could expect minimum RTO be 5 minutes and RPO
be 1 second for single AZ outage.

In case of region outage, it takes more time to promote the read replica and while
promoting, new snapshot of RDS are taken to reduce next time RPO. In addtionally,
since we does not implement auto promotion, we expect some down time for staff to
be paged and take action. In general, the whole process of promoting should take
above 20 minutes in total as in our experimental. On the other hand, automatic
backups of AWS ensuring minimum RPO still be less than 1 second.

Conclusion:
Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: 5 minutes
Minimum RTO for a single region outage: 1 second
Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: 20 minutes
Minimum RPO for a single region outage: 1 second
